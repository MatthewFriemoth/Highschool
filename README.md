This repository is a list of a few of the things I programmed when I was in high school. Most of this code is outdated and not nearly up to par with what I could do now. In fact, most of it will be in Lua using Roblox’s game engine so it has very little Object-Oriented code for it. I’ve written tens of thousands of lines of code in Roblox because its how I first got interested in programming, but this is just some of the interesting parts I managed to scrape together.
